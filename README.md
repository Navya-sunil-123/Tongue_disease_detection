# Diabetes_detection_using_tongue_images

This project focuses on developing an AI-based tongue imaging system for disease detection, inspired by Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). Using machine learn-ing and computer vision, the system analyzes tongue features such as color, texture, and coating to identify potential health conditions. The model is trained on annotated tongue image datasets and employs deep learning algorithms for accurate predictions. Additionally, explainable AI (XAI) techniques ensure transparency by providing insights into the predictions. The system acts as an assistive tool for doctors, offering preliminary diagnoses while allowing medical professionals to conduct further tests. The primary goal is to enable early disease detection, making healthcare more accessible and proactive. By integrating AI with traditional diagnostic methods, this project contributes to modern healthcare advancements, helping individuals monitor their health with greater accuracy and efficiency. Ultimately, the system enhances medical decision-making, bridging the gap between technology and preventive healthcare.
